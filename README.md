You can find more details about the implementation and description of all methods and constructors here.

### Preriquisites

In order to use this BST class your compiler needs to support C++11 Standard. If you use a GCC compiler, at least GCC 4.8.1 is needed.

### How to use

Clone this repo to your local machine and move your .cpp files to the src folder inside the project.

## Running the tests

Inside the src folder you will find a drive_bst.cpp that has a few unit tests. Compile and run this file to check if everything is okay.
```
g++ -std=c++11 drive_bst.cpp -g && ./a.out
```
If all tests pass, you can start playing around with the BST by incluind bst.h in your own .cpp files.
